* Background
  Recently, I am reading a really tough paper published on STOC in this year.
  I'm really slow to make a progress on it (I spend nearly a month to read a 12 page paper. so, very upset).
  The main issue is that I can't read while taking some notes on PDF simultaneously.
  The notes I mentioned here mainly refers to math equations, i.e. I want to take notes with latex.
  But I have not found any useable applications of this type on mac yet.
  So, I plan to make my own PDF reader, which supports writting latex note inside a PDF file.

* Progress
** Stop Developing
   Sadly, I find that reading paper with hand writting notes gives me a better understanding of the paper.
   So, in the future, I might just take notes with my ipad.
** The progress that I have made
   However, I have alreadly made a fully functional PDF reader with could let you add notes to it using latex.
   But it is crudely maded, and have a lot of space to imporve.
** Why should I keep this repo   
   The cocoa development is really hard for me, since I'm not familiar with swift and xcode.
   And it tooks me several days to build this app.
   The time that I spent on this project is not wasted, because this project shows the basic idea of how to develop such a pdf note taker on mac.
   So, it could be seen as a reference, for if I want to develop some cocoa apps on mac in the future.
   Or, if someday, I change my mind and think that taking latex notes in pdf is better than hand writting notes on ipad, then I will go back continue working on this project.
